I'm a junior Java developer. I found my passion in programming and live with it since then it's challenging and wonderful. I live in Warsow and currently looking for a place to put my skills to use.


My Interest in Java are web development: Spring, Spring Boot, MVC, REST API, and things that go with it SQL, Thymeleaf, Bootstrap, Jenkins, Tomcat, Angular, HTML, CSS, JavaScript. All these wonderful and useful aspects of web programming are included in my projects.

My personal favorites are algorithms and programmatic challenges.

Besides programming, there are things that I found useful and helpful in my learning journey: learning practices mainly Pomodoro technique:), Tony Buzan's Mind Maps and thoughts practices, keyboard master, meditations, hypnosis, juggling, guitar, funny things I love to laugh, sport lot of sport and last but not least books.

I dedicated myself to become a software engineer and focus to achieve it. Now after 2 years I'm ready to put my awesome skills to work.
