I'm a junior Java developer. I found my passion in programming it became my life it's challenging and wonderful. I live in Warsow and currently looking for a place to put my skills to use.



# My Interest in Java

Server side programmnig but also web development: Spring, Spring Boot, REST API, and things that go with it: Hibernate, MySQL, JDBC, MVC, JSP, Thymeleaf, Bootstrap, Jax-RS, Tomcat, Angular, OKTA, HTML, CSS, JavaScript, TypeScript, AWS, Git. All these wonderful and useful aspects of programming are included in my projects.

My personal favorites are algorithms and programmatic challenges

The beginning
  <br>
I was a sales guy for years and wanted to get into a software company, so I learn a little about programming. After a while, I found out that this stuff is  engaging, solving the exercises is so strangly rewarding propoptionaly to difficulty. The library was mine learning ground, where I found friends who learn diferent things one was studying JavaScript. Discussions about a data structures and mental process of learing was thrilling. I got sucked into learning curiosity, was winning I wanted more and more.

The first steps I took was with Coursera courses: learning how to learn, [computer science fundamentals & Java basics, ] (https://coursera.org/share/58d86a3f9fdfe25e90012072d2cb758b ) [more advanced Java] (https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/57790974/131525387-5df6ca4d-8db5-44ea-91b6-2d042a48689d.jpg), and finally [Algorithms] (https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/57790974/131529228-db168e4a-a67a-4ae8-a625-62750bbac3e9.jpg) but here stuff were hard only 10% success rate on Coursera After this I went to khan Acadamy to grind up math that dusted since mine engineering classes:) 252 video and 100 h of test done and I went thro the fire of Algorith class. Coursera set me up for a 1 year gave me greate programming skills and some general computer science knowlege to understand what to do next. Yes I had to figure the rest on my own. First was [Database Design] (https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ztHopE5Wnpc&list=RDCMUC8butISFwT-Wl7EV0hUK0BQ&index=2) Cayleb Curry is a great guy, [MySQL FreeCodeCamp Course] (https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HXV3zeQKqGY&t=16s) I realize that there is everything I gonna need, next is going to be the greatest stuff so far THE SPRING FRAMEWORK!!! lol the web development. From Chad Derby Love2Code [Spring & Hibernate] (https://www.udemy.com/certificate/UC-793e2670-66b7-4fbf-beae-75fd2fb6cb07/), [Full Stack Angular Spring Boot] (https://www.udemy.com/certificate/UC-73d4c3de-3f9e-4518-8ada-7850412a79dd/), [JSP Servlets JDBC] (https://www.udemy.com/certificate/UC-bb22db36-8fd5-4105-8d89-0100a4878dac/), [Deploy Java Spring to AWS] (https://www.udemy.com/certificate/UC-6d7b8480-fa39-41f4-8976-f86c0399edd5/)

# Besides programming

If life became a quest for knowledge of Java programming it's exciting. The challenge is how to do it 10h/d 6d/week and stay consistent for years yea 2.3y. Need for mental variety and healthy habits are necessary:)  
 There are things that I found useful and helpful to keep me up and running smoothly and relaxed: learning practices mainly Pomodoro technique:), Tony Buzan's Mind Maps and thoughts practices mnemonics, walks in the park, friends, keyboard master, meditations, hypnosis, juggling, guitar, funny things I love to laugh, sport lot of sport and last but not least books.

Coding calms me down.

I dedicated myself to software engineering and focus to achieve. Now after 2 years I'm ready to put my awesome skills to work.
