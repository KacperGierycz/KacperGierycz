I'm a Java developer. I found my passion in programming it became my life it's challenging and wonderful. Grit, perservirence and focus are my way. 



# My Interest in Java 

Server-side programming with web development: Spring, Spring Boot, REST API, JUnit and things that go with it: Mockito, Hibernate, MySQL, JDBC, MVC, JSP, Thymeleaf, Bootstrap, Jenkins, Tomcat, Angular, OKTA, HTML, CSS, JavaScript, TypeScript, AWS, Git. All these wonderful and useful aspects of programming are included in my projects.

My personal favorites are algorithms and programmatic challenges on [HackerRankProfile](https://www.hackerrank.com/kacpergierycz)

  <br />
The beginning
  <br>
I was a sales guy for years and wanted to get into a software, so I learn a little about programming. After a while, I found out that this stuff is engaging, solving the exercises was rewarding proportionally to difficulty. The library was my learning ground, where I found friends who learn different things, one was studying JavaScript other UML. Discussions about programming and the mental process of learning were thrilling. I got sucked into learning curiosity, was winning I wanted more and more.
  <br>
  
The first steps I took was with Coursera courses: learning how to learn, [computer science fundamentals & Java basics,](https://coursera.org/share/58d86a3f9fdfe25e90012072d2cb758b), then [more advanced Java](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/57790974/131525387-5df6ca4d-8db5-44ea-91b6-2d042a48689d.jpg), and finally [Data Structures and Algorithms](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/57790974/131529228-db168e4a-a67a-4ae8-a625-62750bbac3e9.jpg) in previous courses material was hard but in a noobie friendly way, here stuff begins to be hard just like it should be, peers have only 10% success rate for passing. Math was an issue the precalculus level needed at least. I asked a friend mathematician who was giving lessosns in the library;
  <br>
  -What is discreet mathematics?
  <br>
  -The dark and twisted math with a letter e in it (he answer with a puzzling look).
  <br>
  -Yea this is what I'm looking for
  <br>
  -This material was far back in the academy and I would have to study it again.
  <br> 
  -What now then...
  <br>
  -But I can tell You a secret there is a place where You can learn math for good if you want
  <br>
  -yes yes go on
  <br>
  -The Khan Academy
  <br>
  To the math grinding then, dusted since engineering classes:) [252 videos and 100 h](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/57790974/131519469-3cce47db-6075-4af3-b88c-dcbe807b988e.jpg) of test later [precalculus done](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/57790974/131519490-041a41de-fed6-4d8f-a708-46755d713228.jpg). I had so much fun then math is just wonder so smooth and easy. YEA! I went through the fire of Algorithm class. During this time pandemic came and libraries closed. Was worrying would I be able to study at home, this was challenging and still just pushing a little harder but sometimes relaxing more.
  <br>
  Coursera set me up for a 1.2 year gave me great programming skills and some general computer science knowledge to understand what to do next. Yes, I had to figure the rest on my own. First was [Database Design](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ztHopE5Wnpc&list=RDCMUC8butISFwT-Wl7EV0hUK0BQ&index=2) Cayleb Curry is a great guy, [MySQL FreeCodeCamp Course](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HXV3zeQKqGY&t=16s), w3shool exercise, hacker rank. I realize that there is everything I gonna need. Next is going to be the greatest stuff so far THE SPRING FRAMEWORK!!! the web development. From Chad Derbys Love2Code [Spring & Hibernate](https://www.udemy.com/certificate/UC-793e2670-66b7-4fbf-beae-75fd2fb6cb07/), [Full Stack Angular Spring Boot](https://www.udemy.com/certificate/UC-73d4c3de-3f9e-4518-8ada-7850412a79dd/), [JSP Servlets JDBC](https://www.udemy.com/certificate/UC-bb22db36-8fd5-4105-8d89-0100a4878dac/), [Deploy Java Spring to AWS](https://www.udemy.com/certificate/UC-6d7b8480-fa39-41f4-8976-f86c0399edd5/). After this, I have done Spring home Guides and tutorials. Switched to [Java Brains](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCYt1sfh5464XaDBH0oH_o7Q) and [Telusco](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UC59K-uG2A5ogwIrHw4bmlEg) and done almost all Courses(Hibernate, JSP/Servlets, JAX-RS, REST, Spring Boot, Hibernate, JDBC, ...). <br>  Now came the time when I feel I'm ready and need to find real projects and people to discuss ideas to expand and solidify my expertise and share the joy of creativity.
Done [Git Branching](https://learngitbranching.js.org/?locale=en_US) :)

  <summary><b>üçí  The Conclusion </b></summary> 
  <br />
  


  I learn a lot and I'm proud of it.
  <br>
  The way I've chosen needed passion, persistence, iron will to overcome obstacles, intelligence, creativity, curiosity a positive attitude, social and a sense of humor to keep it all together.
  <br>
  There is still a lot to learn and create ahead this is what I'm waiting for.

  <summary><b>üéì My Blog </b></summary> 
  
  Recently I went thoro  technical interviews and from them I gain lot's of knowleage. The bigest part is My gratitude toward requruiters that give me the chance to check my knowleage and enchance it while speking with masters porgrammers. TAB
  Mostly programmers I met are very strict persons with their mainds focuse on being precise and fast the fast when concept is well known you are fast. 
  The knowleage that is being tested is mostly the commputer concepts mostly the teory like SOLID, Agile, Clean Code, Object Oriented Programming, Test Driven Development, Data Structures, Multitreading, Streams, Spring Framework, Design Patterns abstraction this is so common question that today I decide to memorise this beautifull sentence "In essense the abstraction is preserving the information that is releveant in a given context, and forgeting information that is irrelevant in that context" LINE BREAK - John V. Guttag LINE BREAK
  Well according to this I'm on a quest to get into this concepts and understand them at least to the level of my current undertanding of computer science. 
  The things that I have to press the most are Clan Code, Agile, SOLID 
  The SOLID there is a L and D that I have to leave for leater But S single resposibility, O open for extension close for modification, I interface segregation
  Clean Code now general rules 
  Let Your code be easy to READ and understand
  make introduction give general concepts and let it introduce what will going to happend
  Use descriptive names for methods and classes

# Besides programming

When life became a quest for knowledge of Java programming it's exciting. The challenge is how to do it 8-10h/d 6d/week and stay consistent for years yea 2.5y. Need for mental variety and healthy habits are necessary:)  
 There are things that I found useful and helpful to keep me up and running smoothly and relaxed: learning practices mainly Pomodoro technique:), Tony Buzan's Mind Maps and thoughts practices mnemonics, walks in the park, friends, keyboard master, meditations, self hypnosis, juggling, guitar, funny things I love to laugh, sport lot of sport and last but not least books.
 
#
<!--Coding calms me down.-->
 
#

I set myself to achieve mastery in computer science. I can write application in Java, implements algorithms and have funn doing it.
