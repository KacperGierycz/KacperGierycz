I am a Java developer who has found a true passion in programming. It has become my life, presenting both challenges and wonders. Grit, perseverance, and focus are my guiding principles.



# My Interest in Java 

As a Software Developer with a strong foundation in Java, I specialize in technologies such as Spring, Spring Boot, REST APIs, and JUnit. My expertise extends to related tools and frameworks, including Mockito, Hibernate, MySQL, JDBC, MVC, JSP, Thymeleaf, Bootstrap, Jenkins, Tomcat, Angular, AWS, and Git. These powerful and versatile aspects of programming are integral to my projects.

My personal favorites are algorithms and programmatic challenges on [HackerRankProfile](https://www.hackerrank.com/kacpergierycz)


<h2 align="left" id="macropower-tech">How I learn</h2>

<br>
<details>	
  <summary><b>⚡  The beginning...story</b></summary> 
  <br />
The beginning
  <br>
I spent years working in sales. While selling IT services, I got the idea to venture into the software business, which led me to start learning a bit about programming. Over time, I discovered that programming was incredibly engaging; solving exercises was rewarding, especially as they increased in difficulty.

The library became my learning ground, where I met friends who were studying various subjects—one was focused on JavaScript, another on UML. Our discussions about programming and the cognitive processes involved in learning were thrilling. I became deeply curious and found myself wanting to learn more and more.
  <br>
  
The first steps I took was with Coursera courses: learning how to learn, [computer science fundamentals & Java basics,](https://coursera.org/share/58d86a3f9fdfe25e90012072d2cb758b), then [more advanced Java](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/57790974/131525387-5df6ca4d-8db5-44ea-91b6-2d042a48689d.jpg), and finally [Data Structures and Algorithms](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/57790974/131529228-db168e4a-a67a-4ae8-a625-62750bbac3e9.jpg) in previous courses material was hard but in a noobie friendly way, here stuff begins to be hard just like it should be, peers have only 10% success rate for passing. Math was an issue the precalculus level needed at least. I asked a friend mathematician who was giving lessosns in the library;
  <br>
  -What is discreet mathematics?
  <br>
  -The dark and twisted math with a letter e in it (he answer with a puzzling look).
  <br>
  -Yea this is what I'm looking for
  <br>
  -This material was far back in the academy and I would have to study it again.
  <br> 
  -What now then...
  <br>
  -But I can tell You a secret there is a place where You can learn math for good if you want
  <br>
  -yes yes go on
  <br>
  -The Khan Academy
  <br>
  To the math grinding then, dusted since engineering classes:) [252 videos and 100 h](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/57790974/131519469-3cce47db-6075-4af3-b88c-dcbe807b988e.jpg) of test later [precalculus done](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/57790974/131519490-041a41de-fed6-4d8f-a708-46755d713228.jpg). I had so much fun then math is just wonder so smooth and easy. YEA! I went through the fire of Algorithm class. During this time pandemic came and libraries closed. Was worrying would I be able to study at home, this was challenging and still just pushing a little harder but sometimes relaxing more.
  <br>
  Coursera set me up for a 1.2 year gave me great programming skills and some general computer science knowledge to understand what to do next. Yes, I had to figure the rest on my own. First was [Database Design](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ztHopE5Wnpc&list=RDCMUC8butISFwT-Wl7EV0hUK0BQ&index=2) Cayleb Curry is a great guy, [MySQL FreeCodeCamp Course](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HXV3zeQKqGY&t=16s), w3shool exercise, hacker rank. I realize that there is everything I gonna need. Next is going to be the greatest stuff so far THE SPRING FRAMEWORK!!! the web development. From Chad Derbys Love2Code [Spring & Hibernate](https://www.udemy.com/certificate/UC-793e2670-66b7-4fbf-beae-75fd2fb6cb07/), [Full Stack Angular Spring Boot](https://www.udemy.com/certificate/UC-73d4c3de-3f9e-4518-8ada-7850412a79dd/), [JSP Servlets JDBC](https://www.udemy.com/certificate/UC-bb22db36-8fd5-4105-8d89-0100a4878dac/), [Deploy Java Spring to AWS](https://www.udemy.com/certificate/UC-6d7b8480-fa39-41f4-8976-f86c0399edd5/). After this, I have done Spring home Guides and tutorials. Switched to [Java Brains](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCYt1sfh5464XaDBH0oH_o7Q) and [Telusco](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UC59K-uG2A5ogwIrHw4bmlEg) and done almost all Courses(Hibernate, JSP/Servlets, JAX-RS, REST, Spring Boot, Hibernate, JDBC, ...). <br>  Now came the time when I feel I'm ready and need to find real projects and people to discuss ideas to expand and solidify my expertise and share the joy of creativity.

**Saturday 07.05.22 I started Blog** <br>

  I recently went through several technical interviews and gained a lot of knowledge from them. I am especially grateful to the recruiters who gave me the opportunity to test and enhance my knowledge while speaking with expert programmers.

Most programmers I met are very precise and focused individuals. Their speed of thinking improves significantly when they are well-acquainted with a concept. The knowledge being tested in these interviews is primarily based on computer science concepts and theory.
  1. SOLID
  2. Agile
  3. Clean Code
  4. Object Oriented Programming
  5. Test Driven Development
  6. Data Structures
  7. Multitreading
  8. Streams
  9. Spring Framework
  10. Design Patterns
  11. SQL
  12. JAVA fundamentals
  13. CI/CD pipeline Unknown
  14. flyway/liquidbase Unknown
  
  <br>
   Abstraction is a common question, so I decided to memorize this beautiful sentence: <br> *"In essence, the abstraction is preserving the information that is   relevant in a given context, and forgetting information that is irrelevant in that context"* <br> - John V. Guttag <br><br>
  Inspired by this, I am on a quest to delve into these concepts and understand them at least to the level of my current knowledge in computer science. The areas I need to focus on the most are Clean Code, Agile, and SOLID principles.

Regarding SOLID, I will leave the Liskov Substitution Principle (L) and Dependency Inversion Principle (D) for later. For now, I am concentrating on:

S: Single Responsibility Principle
O: Open/Closed Principle
I: Interface Segregation Principle
For Clean Code, here are some general rules:

Ensure your code is easy to read and understand.
Provide an introduction with general concepts to set the stage for what follows.
Use descriptive names for methods and classes.
If a method is too long, try to extract parts into separate methods.
There is much more to this, but these are the foundational guidelines I am focusing on.
  
  Agile
  This has a great name everyone would like this name being their quality lol
  The values are quite fine they are:<br>
  - Individuals and interactions over process and tools
  - Working software over comprehensive documentation
  - Customer collaboration over contract negotiation
  - Responding to change by following the plan
 
  Yes this sounds great

  I haven’t decided whether to write in a standard diary format or to modify the text with advanced knowledge. I think both approaches would be fine, but I prefer the journal-like style.

Regarding my progress, I’ve made a significant breakthrough in my typing practice. I was stuck for a while, trying to type as fast as possible, but I kept making numerous mistakes. Eventually, I decided to slow down and focus on precision. This change led to a huge improvement in accuracy with little to no loss in speed, which was surprising. Even when I felt like I was typing slower, I maintained the same speed as before. The conclusion is that focusing on correctness actually makes things faster without realizing it. I suspect that trying to type accurately speeds up your thinking process, which might be the cause. I will continue this approach because my progress is now consistent, and it seems to be the right way to go. The essence is that working smarter is better than working harder!

  Yesterday, I had a great conversation with a developer and added a few topics to my list. He mentioned an interesting point: after some time, programming can become a bit monotonous. However, there are ways to keep it engaging, such as interacting with clients and exploring their interests. 
  
  12.05.22
  Another day another oportunity 
  I find out that the more I speak the more I get use to speaking with developers and geting in theig thinking process and like them and it's a mutual process.
  But to the main technicall stuff the SQL zoo I greatly consider the best place to learn SQL and it thought me well.
  I had to make a revisit to https://learngitbranching.js.org to get to:<br>
  rebase -i C1 C3 copying the C1 C2 C3 from head location to new brach or rearange them <br>
  checkout C3  moving with main or into branches
  branch -f foo C3 moves foo to the C3 commit
  <br>
  need to find out how to move thro hash maps using streams!!

  24.05.22
  After a week long holidays I'm back in programming there is some thinkg that i want to write about last day of recruitment but about it later here now the yesterday. Yesterday was first day after a holidays the first holidays after 3 long years it's almost hard to figure out how long this period is 3 years of constatnt learning passed like one or even less and there is still more to learn it's the best part. During last technical interview i encouter the best understanding about a way I can go into after all this algorithms and math i can go to neural networks, the graphs was my favorite part of all and this seems to be a natural extension, first ofcourse the Samsung inducion:) and all the stuf with kotlin multithreading and static analyzis and clean code and all of this. Yest It will be a great adventure cant wait. But to the first day it was hard to swich to working hours and to get into programing but the progres have been made and I see the benefit of fresh mind I setup InteliJ IDEA git and started with multithreading, streams lambdas today books came had to go for them. I'm exited.
  
  
  30.05.22
  Have less and less time the more I practice for Samsung there is more to notice but now have to practice then I note only Topics.
  Concurency I just started but find out have to get this it's 10 h to get a greter understanding
  Streams well understand done some examples and thing is clear
  Optional just Optional
  Kotlin on jetBrains great platforn there is a lot I'm in 1/5 
  sonar just started
  
  06.06.22
  The Induction is done it hapend so fast now first week in Samsung the work culture is the bigest thing The Samsung have to offer people are helpfull and easy going focuse on work of course but open to discussions. I had a greate guy for a part leader the guy that is not hesitating in correting me if there is something worong and I'm gretfull for this insight the learning is double this way. The amout of stuff that is to setup is menagable have to be carefull with helpfullnes of guys becouse the best lerning is a way thro fire of understanding and I have to train concepts and recall the stuff. Yes soon the programming will finaly be upon me and I will swimm deep in Java to program the program I'm just little afraid that I will sweem so deep it would be hard to get in to the surface again but have to go finally I'm walking my path.
  
  21.02.23
  Long time passed since I wrote someting last. I am doing revision of my knowleage of Java, Spring, SQL. Now grinding java on Oracle docs and I found them very good like a source of material quite surpising there was a time I consider it a waste of time. Now its place with best knowleage and examples tried to find the Spring in simmilar fasion but well I need to explre some more in spring.io.
  Well java basics JVM, JRE, JDK, variables, classes  
  
  23.02.23 
  After some time in Oracle Java documentation I have realized that there is no better place to learn Java all others are just trying to reinvent the weel and in the process some of them are corupting the subject. After this i know that I'm going to stay on Oracle for some time week is a realistic estimation. Some progres has been made in Spring REST learning mostly some annotations for REST but still need some more. 
  I realize that I have to redo my CV in complitly different way more specialized in the way of things I'm relearning now. Core Java, Spring, SQL and only this.

# Besides programming

When life became a quest for knowledge of Java programming it's exciting. The challenge is how to do it 8-10h/d 6d/week and stay consistent for years yea 2.5y. Need for mental variety and healthy habits are necessary:)  
 There are things that I found useful and helpful to keep me up and running smoothly and relaxed: learning practices mainly Pomodoro technique:), Tony Buzan's Mind Maps and thoughts practices mnemonics, walks in the park, friends, keyboard master, meditations, self hypnosis, juggling, guitar, funny things I love to laugh, sport lot of sport and last but not least books.
 
#
<!--Coding calms me down.-->
 
#

I set myself to achieve mastery in computer science. I can write application in Java, implements algorithms and have funn doing it.
