I'm a Java developer. I found my passion in programming it became my life it's challenging and wonderful. Grit, perservirence and focus are my way. 



# My Interest in Java 

Server-side programming with web development: Spring, Spring Boot, REST API, JUnit and things that go with it: Mockito, Hibernate, MySQL, JDBC, MVC, JSP, Thymeleaf, Bootstrap, Jenkins, Tomcat, Angular, AWS, Git. All these wonderful and useful aspects of programming are included in my projects.

My personal favorites are algorithms and programmatic challenges on [HackerRankProfile](https://www.hackerrank.com/kacpergierycz)

  <br />
The beginning
  <br>
I was a sales guy for years and wanted to get into a software, so I learn a little about programming. After a while, I found out that this stuff is engaging, solving the exercises was rewarding proportionally to difficulty. The library was my learning ground, where I found friends who learn different things, one was studying JavaScript other UML. Discussions about programming and the mental process of learning were thrilling. I got sucked into learning curiosity, was winning I wanted more and more.
  <br>
  
The first steps I took was with Coursera courses: learning how to learn, [computer science fundamentals & Java basics,](https://coursera.org/share/58d86a3f9fdfe25e90012072d2cb758b), then [more advanced Java](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/57790974/131525387-5df6ca4d-8db5-44ea-91b6-2d042a48689d.jpg), and finally [Data Structures and Algorithms](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/57790974/131529228-db168e4a-a67a-4ae8-a625-62750bbac3e9.jpg) in previous courses material was hard but in a noobie friendly way, here stuff begins to be hard just like it should be, peers have only 10% success rate for passing. Math was an issue the precalculus level needed at least. I asked a friend mathematician who was giving lessosns in the library;
  <br>
  -What is discreet mathematics?
  <br>
  -The dark and twisted math with a letter e in it (he answer with a puzzling look).
  <br>
  -Yea this is what I'm looking for
  <br>
  -This material was far back in the academy and I would have to study it again.
  <br> 
  -What now then...
  <br>
  -But I can tell You a secret there is a place where You can learn math for good if you want
  <br>
  -yes yes go on
  <br>
  -The Khan Academy
  <br>
  To the math grinding then, dusted since engineering classes:) [252 videos and 100 h](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/57790974/131519469-3cce47db-6075-4af3-b88c-dcbe807b988e.jpg) of test later [precalculus done](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/57790974/131519490-041a41de-fed6-4d8f-a708-46755d713228.jpg). I had so much fun then math is just wonder so smooth and easy. YEA! I went through the fire of Algorithm class. During this time pandemic came and libraries closed. Was worrying would I be able to study at home, this was challenging and still just pushing a little harder but sometimes relaxing more.
  <br>
  Coursera set me up for a 1.2 year gave me great programming skills and some general computer science knowledge to understand what to do next. Yes, I had to figure the rest on my own. First was [Database Design](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ztHopE5Wnpc&list=RDCMUC8butISFwT-Wl7EV0hUK0BQ&index=2) Cayleb Curry is a great guy, [MySQL FreeCodeCamp Course](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HXV3zeQKqGY&t=16s), w3shool exercise, hacker rank. I realize that there is everything I gonna need. Next is going to be the greatest stuff so far THE SPRING FRAMEWORK!!! the web development. From Chad Derbys Love2Code [Spring & Hibernate](https://www.udemy.com/certificate/UC-793e2670-66b7-4fbf-beae-75fd2fb6cb07/), [Full Stack Angular Spring Boot](https://www.udemy.com/certificate/UC-73d4c3de-3f9e-4518-8ada-7850412a79dd/), [JSP Servlets JDBC](https://www.udemy.com/certificate/UC-bb22db36-8fd5-4105-8d89-0100a4878dac/), [Deploy Java Spring to AWS](https://www.udemy.com/certificate/UC-6d7b8480-fa39-41f4-8976-f86c0399edd5/). After this, I have done Spring home Guides and tutorials. Switched to [Java Brains](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCYt1sfh5464XaDBH0oH_o7Q) and [Telusco](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UC59K-uG2A5ogwIrHw4bmlEg) and done almost all Courses(Hibernate, JSP/Servlets, JAX-RS, REST, Spring Boot, Hibernate, JDBC, ...). <br>  Now came the time when I feel I'm ready and need to find real projects and people to discuss ideas to expand and solidify my expertise and share the joy of creativity.

  <summary><b>üçí  The Conclusion </b></summary> 
  <br />
  


  I learn a lot and I'm proud of it.
  <br>
  The way I've chosen needed passion, persistence, iron will to overcome obstacles, intelligence, creativity, curiosity a positive attitude, social and a sense of humor to keep it all together.
  <br>
  There is still a lot to learn and create ahead this is what I'm waiting for.

  <summary><b>üìò My Blog </b></summary> 
  <br>
  
**Saturday 07.05.22 I started Blog** <br>

¬† I recently went thoro technical interviews and gained lots of knowledge from them. The biggest part is My gratitude toward recruiters that give me the chance to check my knowledge and enhance it while speaking with master programmers.<br>
¬† Most programmers I met are very strict persons with their minds focused on being precise and fast the speed of thinking about something comes when the concept is well known. The knowledge that is being tested is mostly the computer concepts the theory:¬†
  1. SOLID
  2. Agile
  3. Clean Code
  4. Object Oriented Programming
  5. Test Driven Development
  6. Data Structures
  7. Multitreading
  8. Streams
  9. Spring Framework
  10. Design Patterns
  11. SQL
  12. JAVA fundamentals
  13. CI/CD pipeline Unknown
  14. flyway/liquidbase Unknown
  
  <br>
   Abstraction this is so common question I decide to memorize this beautiful sentence <br> *"In essence, the abstraction is preserving the information that is   relevant in a given context, and forgetting information that is irrelevant in that context"* <br> - John V. Guttag <br><br>
  Well according to this I'm on a quest to get into these concepts and understand them at least to the level of my current understanding of computer science.
  The things that I have to press the most are Clean Code, Agile, SOLID
  The SOLID there is an L and D that I have to leave for later But S single responsibility, O open for extension close for modification, I interface segregation
  Clean Code now general rules:
  Let Your code be easy to READ and understand
  make an introduction give general concepts and let it introduce what will go to happen
  Use descriptive names for methods and classes
  If the method is too long try to extract part into another method
  there is much more to this 
  
  Agile
  This has a great name everyone would like this name being their quality lol
  The values are quite fine they are:<br>
  - Individuals and interactions over process and tools
  - Working software over comprehensive documentation
  - Customer collaboration over contract negotiation
  - Responding to change by following the plan
 
  Yes this sounds great
  
10.05.22
¬† I didn't decide what form should I write the standard diary journal or modify text and material with advanced¬†knowledge I think both would be fine I like the jurnal-like style.
¬† Well to the actual progress I made one big one in the matter of learning by itself regarding fast typing practice. I was stuck for some time with progress trying to type as fast I can possible, but once I was tired of amounts of mistakes decided to go with slower but more precise, and with this came a huge improvement in accuracy, and little to no loss in speed what was a shock and even when I was thinking that I'm typing slower actually I keep the same speed like when typing as fast as possible. Well the conclusion is focusing on correctness makes things faster without knowing it and the time is distorted somehow I suspect that when you are trying to type accurately you are thinking faster and this may be the cause. I will keep this way because the progress is daily now and looks like it's a way to go. Well, the best essence is harder is not better than smarter:)lol
¬†I'm on how to write [basic git formatting](https://docs.github.com/en/get-started/writing-on-github/getting-started-with-writing-and-formatting-on-github/basic-writing-and-formatting-syntax#relative-links) text looks better after this next one grammar how to connect Grammarly to gitreadmy.
¬† 
¬† 11.05.22
¬† Yesterday I had a great conversation with a¬†developer and got a few topics to add to the list. ¬†He mentioned one curious thing that after some time programming can grow a little boring and there are things that can add to the craft like contact with clients its interests.¬†
  
  12.05.22
  Another day another oportunity 
  I find out that the more I speak the more I get use to speaking with developers and geting in theig thinking process and like them and it's a mutual process.
  But to the main technicall stuff the SQL zoo I greatly consider the best place to learn SQL and it thought me well.
  I had to make a revisit to https://learngitbranching.js.org to get to:<br>
  rebase -i C1 C3 copying the C1 C2 C3 from head location to new brach or rearange them <br>
  checkout C3  moving with main or into branches
  branch -f foo C3 moves foo to the C3 commit
  <br>
  need to find out how to move thro hash maps using streams!!
  
  <br />
  
  24.05.22
  After a week long holidays I'm back in programming there is some thinkg that i want to write about last day of recruitment but about it later here now the yesterday. Yesterday was first day after a holidays the first holidays after 3 long years it's almost hard to figure out how long this period is 3 years of constatnt learning passed like one or even less and there is still more to learn it's the best part. During last technical interview i encouter the best understanding about a way I can go into after all this algorithms and math i can go to neural networks, the graphs was my favorite part of all and this seems to be a natural extension, first ofcourse the Samsung inducion:) and all the stuf with kotlin multithreading and static analyzis and clean code and all of this. Yest It will be a great adventure cant wait. But to the first day it was hard to swich to working hours and to get into programing but the progres have been made and I see the benefit of fresh mind I setup InteliJ IDEA git and started with multithreading, streams lambdas today books came had to go for them. I'm exited.
  
  
  30.05.22
  Have less and less time the more I practice for Samsung there is more to notice but now have to practice then I note only Topics.
  Concurency I just started but find out have to get this it's 10 h to get a greter understanding
  Streams well understand done some examples and thing is clear
  Optional just Optional
  Kotlin on jetBrains great platforn there is a lot I'm in 1/5 
  sonar just started

# Besides programming

When life became a quest for knowledge of Java programming it's exciting. The challenge is how to do it 8-10h/d 6d/week and stay consistent for years yea 2.5y. Need for mental variety and healthy habits are necessary:)  
 There are things that I found useful and helpful to keep me up and running smoothly and relaxed: learning practices mainly Pomodoro technique:), Tony Buzan's Mind Maps and thoughts practices mnemonics, walks in the park, friends, keyboard master, meditations, self hypnosis, juggling, guitar, funny things I love to laugh, sport lot of sport and last but not least books.
 
#
<!--Coding calms me down.-->
 
#

I set myself to achieve mastery in computer science. I can write application in Java, implements algorithms and have funn doing it.
