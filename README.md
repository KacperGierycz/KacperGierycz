I'm a junior Java developer. I found my passion in programming it became my life it's challenging and wonderful. I live in Warsow and currently looking for a place to put my skills to use.



# My Interest in Java

Server side programmnig but also web development: Spring, Spring Boot, REST API, and things that go with it: Hibernate, MySQL, JDBC, MVC, JSP, Thymeleaf, Bootstrap, Jax-RS, Tomcat, Angular, OKTA, HTML, CSS, JavaScript, TypeScript, AWS, Git. All these wonderful and useful aspects of programming are included in my projects.

My personal favorites are algorithms and programmatic challenges.
